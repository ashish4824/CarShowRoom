This directory will contain the 3D car model files in GLB format.

In a real application, you would place the following GLB files here:
- sport-coupe.glb
- luxury-sedan.glb
- electric-suv.glb

These files would be downloaded from 3D model marketplaces like Sketchfab, CGTrader, or Clara.io.
You can find free and paid 3D car models on these platforms and convert them to GLB format if needed.

For now, the application will display a simplified 3D car model as a placeholder.

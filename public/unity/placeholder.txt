This directory will contain the Unity WebGL build files for the car showroom.

In a real application, you would build your Unity project for WebGL and place the following files here:
- car-showroom.loader.js
- car-showroom.data
- car-showroom.framework.js
- car-showroom.wasm

These files would be generated by Unity when building for WebGL platform.
